The first use case is the using store, it includes two actors: the customer, and the database that stores the products and cart information. This use case has three [requirements](https://github.com/Winter22SOFE2720/CRN-73378-Group-7-Project/tree/main/Requirements#requirements): view products, saving cart, and comparisons. This use case is meant to show how the customers will interact with the online store, and what will be necessary to accomplish that goal.
